request_intro="Article Intros\ngoal: Enticing article/blog introductions that capture the attention of the audience.\n\nTopic: 5 Ways Technology Has Shaped Manufacturing in Recent Years\nVariant a:\nManufacturing is as much a part of our digital future as it is our current reality. When so many people think of manufacturing, they think of industries that involve operating heavy machinery and producing raw materials.\nWe no longer live in an age where factories are a single place to work. Rather, all aspects of the industry involve some form of technology—from the software used to the tools used at home or on the job. Even though manufacturing has evolved, it’s still a cornerstone for any economy. The following article explores five ways that technology has shaped manufacturing in recent years.\n\nVariant b:\nManufacturing is a fast-paced, dynamic industry that has undergone many changes in recent years. The digitization of manufacturing, the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 are just some of the trends reshaping manufacturing.\nThese changes have resulted in continuous transformation and innovations in various areas such as robotics, big data analytics and cloud computing. These innovations have improved the efficiency and quality of production processes while also reducing operational costs for manufacturers. Let’s take a closer look at how technology is reshaping manufacturing today.\n\n\nTopic: 8 Copywriting Tips for Better Marketing Campaigns\nVariant a:\nWhen you think about it, copywriting is a peculiar art. It’s not just about stringing words in a sequence and calling it writing. It’s about putting your audience first, so that your message hits home.\nAnd for all the brands out there that have fallen prey to terrible marketing and copywriting, it’s no wonder why consumers aren’t exactly jumping to buy from them.\nFortunately, this means there’s ample opportunity for you in the market if you can set yourself apart with better marketing and copywriting.\nEvery piece of marketing collateral is an opportunity to set the tone and win your customer’s loyalty. If you want to make sure yours stand out as exceptional, check out these copywriting tips; they are guaranteed to steer your marketing efforts in the right direction.\n\nVariant b:\nAre you launching a new product?

High-street chains such as New Look, Selfridges and H&M have all recently phased out their use of animal skins for this reason. However, the leather trade is worth over £7 billion annually in the UK alone, so it’s not going away any time soon. As a result, anyone who wishes to enter the industry needs to be armed with the facts about it before making a decision. Read on to learn more about the realities of this controversial trade, and how you can fight back against interference from animal rights activists if you are interested in working with leather...\n\nVariant b: \nWhen you think of the leather industry, what do you see? Leather jackets, maybe? Maybe a car upholstered in leather? Think again. The actual production process for both of these things is not as glamorous as we may think. In fact, it’s rather gruesome and inhumane.\nIn this blog post, we will explore the realities of the leather industry and how you can fight back against such cruelty. From slaughterhouse processes to supply chains and more, read on to learn more about what goes into your clothing and how you can help change it for the better.\n\n\nTopic: "

request_idea="Sentence Expander\ngoal: Expand short sentences into more descriptive and interesting ones.\n\ninput: There are about 600 muscles in the human body.\nVariant a: They help us move, give us shape, and let us express ourselves.\nUnfortunately, we can’t go for a second without our muscles losing some of their strength. As you go about your day, your muscles are constantly being challenged. If you’re lifting something heavy, if you’re sitting in a meeting for several hours without moving, or if you’re just getting up out of bed in the morning — any of these things can cause your muscles to lose strength.\nAnd the loss happens quickly. When you’re not using your muscles, they start to break down. This is a normal part of being human. But that doesn’t mean it’s something you have to accept.\nThankfully, there are things you can do to keep your muscles strong. By maintaining your muscle strength, you can keep your body fit and healthy.\n\nVariant b: They come in all shapes and sizes, and each one has a different job. Some muscles help us walk, and others help us smile. Muscles respond to stress, and they change as we use them more or less. Exercise and diet can change the shape and size of your muscles. You can also strengthen your muscles through therapy.\n\ninput: Jim is a hard worker. He works late in the office every day. Whereas Clark is a smart worker. He finishes his tasks smartly before time.\nVariant a: You can be a hard worker and still be considered productive. Productivity is a result of hard work, not the cause. You can be a productive person by using smart work strategies to complete your tasks.\nSmart work strategies can help you become more productive in the workplace. You do not need to work long hours every day to be a hard worker. You just need to work smartly to become a productive person.\n\nVariant b: Hard work alone cannot take you to success. You need smart work to make your hard work more productive and fruitful. And the best way to make your work smart is to plan it.\nYou may have heard the phrase, “fail to plan, plan to fail”. It holds true in most aspects of life. Planning your work makes it more organized and systematic. And thus, it becomes easy to execute.\nPlanning your work also helps you prioritize your tasks. It keeps you away from time-wasting activities. It makes sure you don’t work on unimportant tasks. And most importantly, it makes you more accountable for your work.\nIf you are someone who has to work on a daily basis, you can make your work smart by planning it.\n\ninput:"
